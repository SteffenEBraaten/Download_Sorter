# Download_Sorter <img alt="GitHub" src="https://img.shields.io/github/license/SteffenEBraaten/Download_Sorter">
A simple Python program to keep your downloads folder nice and tidy.

This program will sort your files in diffrent folders based on it's extension type. You are free to add/remove any folder 
or extensions you may want by manipulating the file_extensions.txt file. Some of the file extension in this file is based
upon [FileInfos common file types list](https://fileinfo.com/filetypes/common).
## Set up
At the current time you will need to set the path to the folder that you would like the program to sort. Simply change the
variable "folder_to_sort" to your own path.
## Running the program
To run the program simply write the following:
```bash
 python3 download_sorter.py
 ```
